    # By default Conan strips all RPATHs (see conanbuildinfo.cmake), which
    # causes tests to fail as the executables cannot find the library target.
    # By setting KEEP_RPATHS, Conan does not set CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH and the
    # resulting binaries still have the RPATH information. This is fine because
    # CMake will strip the build RPATH information in the install step.
    #
    # NOTE:
    # Conan's default approach is to use the "imports" feature, which copies
    # all the dependencies into the bin directory. Of course, this doesn't work
    # quite that well for libraries generated in this Project (see Conan
    # documentation).
